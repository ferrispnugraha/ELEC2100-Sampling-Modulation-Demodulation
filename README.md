# ELEC2100-Sampling-Modulation-Demodulation

Learning about Sampling and Nyquist Sampling Theorem through a basic mathematical function.

Implementing modulation by multiplying with sinuosoidal signal and demodulation by remultiplying with Low Pass Filtering via a Butterworth Filter.

Audio sample is "m1.wav", which unfortunately could not be uploaded.
